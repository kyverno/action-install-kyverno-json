    permissions: {}

    name: Install kyverno-json
    steps:
      - name: Install kyverno-json
        uses: kyverno/action-install-kyverno-json@main
        with:
          release: 'v0.0.1'
      - name: Check install
        run: kyverno-json version
```

  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions: {}

    name: Install kyverno-json
    steps:

        with:
          verify: true
      - name: Check install
        run: kyverno-json version
```

If you want to install `kyverno-json` from its main version by using `go install` under the hood, you can set `release` as `main`.

Once you do that, `kyverno-json` will be installed via `go install` which means that please ensure that go is installed.

Example of installing `kyverno-json` via `go install`:

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions: {}

    name: Install kyverno-json via go install
    steps:
      - name: Install go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'
          check-latest: true
      - name: Install kyverno-json
        uses: kyverno/action-install-kyverno-json@main
        with:
          release: main
      - name: Check install
        run: kyverno-json version
```
